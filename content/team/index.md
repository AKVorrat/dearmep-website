This is a project of the digital rights NGO epicenter.works. We have a [history](https://en.epicenter.works/history) of novel campaigning tools. In 2013 we launched [www.savetheinternet.eu](https://www.savetheinternet.eu) and sent faxes to the printers of Members of the European Parliament in order to convince the EU to adopt [strong Net Neutrality legsilation](https://www.wsj.com/articles/eu-takes-strict-stance-on-net-neutrality-1472577087). In 2019, we launched the [www.pledge2019.eu](https://www.pledge2019.eu) campaign against uploadfilters in the EU Copyright Directive which connected citizens via telephone to their elected representatives. In 2022 the Chat Control proposal prompted us to reactivate this idea and rewrite the tool from scatch. This "Chat Control" proposal <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/law-enforcement/news/eu-parliament-study-slams-online-child-abuse-material-proposal/">undermines privacy, encryption and does irreparable harm to our online world</a>.

A huge thanks goes out to our developer team:
- Backend developer: [Tim Weber](https://scy.name/), [Eru (Jan Cullmann)](https://i3o.eu), [Philipp](https://github.com/phaabe) and Jörn Bethune
- UI/UX design: [Isabella Horn](https://isabellahorn.com/)
- Frontend developer: [Tobias Mühlberger](https://muehlberger.dev)
- Administration and DevOps, [Dominik Polakovics](https://cloonar.com)
- Translation: [Hugo Peixoto](https://hugopeixoto.net) and Jörn Bethune
- Policy Advice on the "Chat Control" proposal, Elina "Khaleesi" Eickstädt
- Project Owner & Advice on EU policymaking, [Thomas Lohninger](epicenter.works/team)

Those developers might be available to help other NGOs to implement DearMEP for their own campaign, but any developer should be able to do so with the free and open source code we will make available on Github once the Chat Control proposal is decided.

The DearMEP project was funded out of epicenter.works’ core. We didn’t ask anyone for permission to develop this tool. We trust the community will determine its value and allow us to continue what we do. As a non-profit we live of [donations](https://spenden.epicenter.works) and our [supporting members](https://support.epicenter.works).
