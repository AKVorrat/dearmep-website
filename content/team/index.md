This is a project of the digital rights NGO epicenter.works. We have a [history](https://en.epicenter.works/history) of novel campaigning tools. In 2013 we launched [www.savetheinternet.eu](https://www.savetheinternet.eu) and sent faxes to the printers of Members of the European Parliament in order to convince the EU to adopt strong ~et Neutrality legsilation to protect the Open Internet. In 2019, we launched the [www.pledge2019.eu](https://www.pledge2019.eu) campaign which connected citizens via telephone with their representatives in order to prevent the adoption of upload filters in the EU Copyright Directive. This 2019 effort fell short by five votes in 2nd reading, but showed us with 168 hours of phone time in one month of campaign duration how powerful such a tool can be. In 2022 the Chat Control proposal prompted us to reactivate this idea and rewrite the tool from scatch. This "Chat Control" proposal mandates the indiscriminate scanning of all private messages of EU citizens for illegal material with error-prone automated systems. We want to empower citizens to make their voices heard about this disastrous proposal that would <a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/law-enforcement/news/eu-parliament-study-slams-online-child-abuse-material-proposal/">undermine privacy, encryption and do irreparable harm to our online world</a>.

A huge thanks goes out to our developer team:
- Backend developer: [Tim Weber](https://scy.name/)
- UI/UX design: [Isabella Horn](https://isabellahorn.com/)
- Frontend developer: [Tobias Mühlberger](https://muehlberger.dev)
- Administration and DevOps, [Dominik Polakovics](https://cloonar.com)
- Policy Advice on the "Chat Control" proposal, Elina "Khaleesi" Eickstädt

Those developers might be available to help other NGOs to implement DearMEP for their own campaign, but any developer should be able to do so with the free and open source code we will make available on Github once the Chat Control proposal is decided.

The DearMEP project was funded out of epicenter.works’ core. We didn’t ask anyone for permission to develop this tool. We trust the community will determine its value and allow us to continue what we do. As a non-profit we live of [donations](https://spenden.epicenter.works) and our [supporting members](https://support.epicenter.works).
