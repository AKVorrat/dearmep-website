## Using our websites

When you visit our websites, we use [Matomo](https://matomo.org), a privacy-friendly analysis tool for website visitors, to collect statistical data that does not permit any conclusion about a specific or identifiable person. In plain language: We do not collect and store any personal data when you visit our website. We operate the Matomo installation ourselves, so that no reconciliation of the collected data with other data sources by third parties is possible. Visitors who send the [Do-Not-Track header](https://donottrack.us/) will not be covered by our Matomo installation.

For the purpose of providing a working website, your IP address will be forwarded to the Internet Service Provider. However, we do not store the IP addresses of visitors to our websites: the lower 16 bits of IPv4 addresses and the lower 96 bits of IPv6 addresses are discarded so that they can not be assigned to ports, devices or people. The legal basis for this processing is our legitimate interest in operating the website according to Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR, which would not be possible without this minimal data processing. You have the right to object to this data processing.

## Newsletter

In order to send you our newsletters, we process your e-mail address, your name (if you specify it during the subscription process), and the fact whether or not you are a supporting member. Under a data processing agreement with us, the data processor is dialog-Mail eMarketing Systems GmbH, Nussgasse 31, A-3434 Wilfersdorf. We do not make use of any tracking or profiling functionality.

We reserve the right to change the software for sending newsletters. However, we will always store your data in Austria. We will not share your data with third parties or use it for purposes other than information on the activities of epicenter.works and the topics we cover.

You can unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time. At the end of every e-mail you will find a link which you can use to unsubscribe. The processing takes place on the basis of your consent per Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. Your data is stored until you withdraw your consent -- which is possible at any time -- or until the newsletter is discontinued. The processing of your status as a supporting member is carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest per Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR to improve our communication with our supporting members. You have the right to object to this processing as per Art. 21 GDPR.

## Donations

If you donate to us, we will store the data necessary for the payment. The basis for this is the contractual relationship of the donation under Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR. We are required by law to keep your information, e.g. to report high donations to the tax office (§ 121a BAO) and to comply with our tax liability (§ 131 BAO). We also forward the data to the company Examina Steuerberatungs GmbH & Co KG, Hainburgerstraße 11, 1030 Vienna, which is responsible for our accounting. We store the data as long as necessary to fulfill our legal obligations. After that your data will be deleted.

Your details will also be processed by the payment service provider you select for payment (PayPal, Flattr, mPay24, SIX Payment Services, bank transfer, SEPA direct debit). These have their own privacy policy. We strive to work towards an optimization of the privacy standards of these service providers even beyond the legal minimum.

## Sponsoring members

When you become a sponsoring member, in addition to the information we collect from your donations (see [above](#donations)) , we also save your contact information to keep you up to date with donation processing, donation deductions, and the use of your donation. This is done on the basis of our legitimate interest in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (f) GDPR to promote the visibility of our work and to improve the communication basis with our supporting members. The data will be stored until you withdraw your membership or the association ceases its activities. You have the right to object to this data processing under Art. 21 GDPR.

If you send data about your clothes profile and size, based on a Gold Sponsoring Membership for receiving a free T-Shirt or hoodie, this data will be stored until shipment of the article. The processing of this data takes place in accordance with Art. 6 (1) (b) GDPR.

## Join us

If you send us your data via the [participation form](https://en.epicenter.works/participate), you agree that we store your data for the purpose of informing you of ways to join us. We only save the data that you fill in the form itself. The data processing takes place on the basis of a consent according to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. Your data will be stored until you revoke your consent - whichever is possible - or the club discontinues its activities.

## Contact by e-mail

If you send us an e-mail, we process the personal data we receive on the basis of a conclusive consent pursuant to Art. 6 (1) (a) GDPR. We store this data as long as it is necessary for the purpose of establishing contact, that is, to answer your request. After that your data will be deleted. You can revoke your consent at any time.

## Transfer to third parties

Generally, we do not share personally identifiable information unless we have your explicit consent. An exception is [data on received donations](#donations), as we have to document them for our accounting. We will never share your information with direct marketing companies, whether for a fee or free of charge.
